<h2 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Class</h2>
Lecture and class work today

Learnt about:
 - Synchresis, coined by Michel Chion refers to the connection between sound and visuals 
 - The "Audiovisual Contract"
 - How can we use this?
   - realism and materialism, used ironically to defy expectations ü§∑
 - Misattribution

 - ASSIGNMENT 3!!!

<h2 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Assignment</h2>

I started by looking at the brief again... Main takeaways: I need to **four** sounds that are a part of a **family**, all sounds need to be made by me and should be short and have something to do with cooking.

Next, I read one of the example texts. I choose "Earcons and Icons: Their Structure
and Common Design Principles" and reading this was super helpful!! 

And the last thing I did before starting with the technical side was collect some influences. 
From class, I liked John Cage's water walk and the Legend of Zelda 'cooking sounds'. And outside of class, I was listening to SOPHIE's song Lemonade from her album product. Very cool and very interesting how she used synths to make a watery sound, like how Daphne Oram theorised (she proposed that any sound should theoretically be re-creatable with a powerful enough synthesiser)

Starting the assignment I was focused on making a 'watery' sound. I'm not sure why I associated the kitchen with water but that was my goal. My initial plan was to record various varied splash and plop sounds and use the variation to create a 'family'.

My first recordings included a bunch of other sounds like knives sharpening and metal clangs but I was determined to make the water work. After cleaning the sounds up in Adobe Audition I imported them into REAPER and started playing with the reverb, EQ, and using gates. I got some fun examples:

Echo plop(which I thought might make a good alarm sound):

Then I tried running the sample through a MIDI. I thought it was alright but it made me want to create the plop sound from scratch.
I followed this video (even though he didn't use REAPER, I tried my best to convert the theory into the REAPER default plug-ins.)

I was really satisfied with the sounds I produced but I wasn't sure how to utilise them in this project?!

Combining what I'd learned about using delays and phasers I made a third test synth that sounded more professional and practical. I had the Duolingo sound effect in mind when I was making this one. Still focussed on the water sound but more general as to be applied with multiple screens and still distinctive. There was a little bit of the brief that talked about considering where the sound is being played from so I looked into what sounds most clear on phone speakers. I found that bass is terrible on most phone speakers so I deliberately made my sounds higher pitch and I imagine the app would use vibrations to add bass.

Then finally it was time to record the earcons. I have a **very** limited understanding of music theory but I was able to cobble together some major scales to give a positive vibe. The achievement sound needed to build up and end on a high, the notification sound needed to be simple and ear-catching, the alarm needed to be high-pitched and repeatable, and the opening sound needed to be a short jingle that also ended on an upbeat.

In response to the brief, I have produced four earcons to be used in the development of the application Cookit.

Each earcon has been custom designed to sound engaging and unique while also maintaining a synonymous style and motif that runs through each audio. A paired back and minimal approach was chosen to suit the graphic design elements included in the provided snippet. 

In accordance to Meera M. Blattner, Denise A. Sumikawa, and Robert M. Greenberg's paper "Earcons and Icons: Their Structure and Common Design Principles" each earcon was made with four objectives in mind; distinctiveness, consistency, learnability and flexibility. 

**Consistency:**
To maintain consistency each earcon was recorded using the same synthesiser. This hoans the sence of  

**Distinctiveness:**
