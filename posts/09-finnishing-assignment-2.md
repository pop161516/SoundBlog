Lecture and class work today

Learnt about:
 - Synchresis, coined by Michel Chion refers to the connection between sound and visuals 
 - The "Audiovisual Contract"
 - How can we use this?
   - realism and materialism, used ironically to defy expectations ü§∑
 - Misattribution

 - ASSIGNMENT 3!!!

<h2 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Assignment</h2>

I started by looking at the brief again... Main takeaways: I need to **four** sounds that are a part of a **family**, all sounds need to be made by me and should be short and have something to do with cooking.

Next, I read one of the example texts. I choose "Earcons and Icons: Their Structure
and Common Design Principles" and reading this was super helpful!! 

And the last thing I did before starting with the technical side was collect some influences. 
From class, I liked John Cage's water walk and the Legend of Zelda 'cooking sounds'. And outside of class, I was listening to SOPHIE's song Lemonade from her album product. Very cool and very interesting how she used synths to make a watery sound, like how Daphne Oram theorised (she proposed that any sound should theoretically be re-creatable with a powerful enough synthesiser)

Starting the assignment I was focused on making a 'watery' sound. I'm not sure why I associated the kitchen with water but that was my goal. My initial plan was to record various varied splash and plop sounds and use the variation to create a 'family'.

My first recordings included a bunch of other sounds like knives sharpening and metal clangs but I was determined to make the water work. After cleaning the sounds up in Adobe Audition I imported them into REAPER and started playing with the reverb, EQ, and using gates. I got some fun examples:

Echo plop(which I thought might make a good alarm sound):

Then I tried running the sample through a MIDI. I thought it was alright but it made me want to create the plop sound from scratch.
I followed this video (even though he didn't use REAPER, I tried my best to convert the theory into the REAPER default plug-ins.)

I was really satisfied with the sounds I produced but I wasn't sure how to utilise them in this project?!

Combining what I'd learned about using delays and phasers I made a third test synth that sounded more professional and practical. I had the Duolingo sound effect in mind when I was making this one. Still focussed on the water sound but more general as to be applied with multiple screens and still distinctive. There was a little bit of the brief that talked about considering where the sound is being played from so I looked into what sounds most clear on phone speakers. I found that bass is terrible on most phone speakers so I deliberately made my sounds higher pitch and I imagine the app would use vibrations to add bass.

Then finally it was time to record the earcons. I have a **very** limited understanding of music theory but I was able to cobble together some major scales to give a positive vibe. The achievement sound needed to build up and end on a high, the notification sound needed to be simple and ear-catching, the alarm needed to be high-pitched and repeatable, and the opening sound needed to be a short jingle that also ended on an upbeat.

<h2 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Sound Diary Assingment 2</h2>

In response to the brief, I have produced four earcons to be used in the development of the application Cookit.

Each earcon has been custom designed to sound engaging and unique while also maintaining a synonymous style and motif that runs through each audio. A paired back and minimal approach was chosen to suit the graphic design elements included in the provided snippet. 

## Theoretical design 
In accordance to Meera M. Blattner, Denise A. Sumikawa, and Robert M. Greenberg's paper "Earcons and Icons: Their Structure and Common Design Principles" each earcon was made with four objectives in mind; consistency, distinctiveness, learnability and flexibility. 

**Consistency:**
To maintain consistency each earcon was recorded using the same synthesiser. This hones the sense of family and provides "advantages... in users have(ing) less to learn... (helping) make predictions about important characteristics of an unfamiliar command" 

*'Earcons and Icons: Their Structure and Common Design Principles, Page 9, 3.3. Iconic Families'*

Furthermore, this bond strengthens brand identity and can create an association between reward/positive emotion and the interface of the application.  

**Distinctiveness & Learnability:**
While each sound is linked by its motif, they all start on different notes, utilise scales in different keys, and have varied patterns and durations. This creates a distinctive earcon that can be easily identified almost within the first note, thus leaving no room for confusion or mistake.

**Flexibility:**
While each sound is made for certain situations they are designed to accommodate a range of contexts for example, the alarm sound was made with the consideration that the sound could interpreted positively when it is heard the first time but becomes more urgent after each repetition, this flexibility of each audio to change in different contexts means they are more likely to synchronize to the user.

**Abstract vs representational:**
This particular earcon set shifted between abstract and representational sound. It was important to maintain the fluid and watery sound for an association with cooking while also creating a modern sleek flexible sound. The blend between the two takes the best of both worlds.

## Technical development
Each earcon was composed in REAPER using the native FX including phasers, 
delays, and synthesisers. 

FX breakdown screenshot:

The design of the earcon was made to mimic the sound of water and bubbles in association with cooking while also feeling modern and applicable to multiple buttons. The earcons mostly utilise higher pitch notes (1) to catch attention for alerts and alarms and (2) because there sounds were designed for the context of a phone speaker which often lacks bass and better represents higher frequencies.

## Reponce to client:
**The brief requested:** 
**individual audios:**
The splash screen be a "short jingle" to which I created a five-note opening sound to set the scene for the application.

The push notification should be an "instant and fun" sound, leading me to create a pair of notes with a delay that emphasises playfulness.

An "alerting" alarm, inspired me to make a repeating beeping to spark the user into action, while also being present.

Finally, a "gamified" achievement sound led me to make a climbing major scale that sounds like the user has won the lottery.

**General guidelines:**
The sounds should emulate the kitchen: Original prototypes were made using samples of real water sounds but sometimes a synthesiser is more effective than the real sound, thus this design was created with a watery synthesiser. It should be a pleasure to hear: Which has been accomplished with various major and upbeat tunes. It should optimised for a phone: taking form in the audio's high pitch(not relying on a strong bass in the phone speaker).
