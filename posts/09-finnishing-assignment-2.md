Lecture and class work today

Learnt about:
 - Synchresis, coined by Michel Chion referse to the connection to sound and visuals 
 - The "Audiovisual Contract"
 - How can we use this?
   - realism and materialism, use ironicly to defy expectations ü§∑
 - Misattribution

 - ASSIGNMENT 3!!!

<h2 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Assignment</h2>

I started by looking at the brief again... Main take aways: I need to **four** sounds that are a part of a **family**, all sounds need to be made by me and they should be short and have something to do with cooking.

Next I read one of the example text. I choose "Earcons and Icons: Their Structure
and Common Design Principles" and reading this was super helpful!! 

And the last thing I did before getting started with the technical side was collect some influnces. 
from class, I really liked John Cage's water walk and the Legend of Zelda 'cooking sounds'. and outside of class I was listening to SOPHIE's song Lemonade from her album product. very cool and very intersting how she used synths to make a watery sound, like how Daphne Oram theorised (she proposed that any sound should theoreticaly be recreatable with a powerful enough synthesiser)

Starting the assingment I was focussed on making a 'watery' sound. I'm not sure why I associated the kitchen with water but that was my goal. My initial plan was to record a bunch of varied spash and plop sounds and use the variation to create a 'family'.

My first recordings included a bunch of other sounds like knives sharpening and metal clangs but I was determind to make th ewater work. after cleaning the soudns up in Adobe Audition I imported them into reaper and started playing with the reverb, EQ, and using gates. I got some fun examples:

echo plop(which I though might make a good alarm sound):

Then I tried running the smaple through a MIDI. I thought it was alright but it made me want to create the plop sound from scratch.
I followed this vedio (even though he didn't use REAPER, I tried my best to convert the theory into the reaper defut plug-in's.)

I was really satiffied with the sounds I produced but I wasn't sure how to utilise them in this project?!

Combining what I'd lernt about using delays and phasers I made a third test synth that sounded more profetional and practical. I had the duolingo sound effect in mind when I was making this one. still focussed on the water sound but more gerneral as to be applyed with multiple screens and still destictive. There was a little bit of the brief that talked about considering where the sound is being played from so i looked into what sounds most clear on phone speakers. I found that bass is terrable on most phone speakers to I deliberatly made my sounds higher pich and I imagein the app would use vibrations to add bass.

Then finaly it was time to record the earcons. I have a **very** limited understanding of music theory but I was able to cobble together some major scales to give a positive vibe. obviously the achivment sound needed to build up and end on a high, the notification sound needed to be simple and ear catching, the alarm needed to be high pitched and repetable, and the opening sound needed to be a short jingle that also ended on a up beat.

Final sounds:
open/spash screen:
