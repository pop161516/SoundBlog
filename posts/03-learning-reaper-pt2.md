<h2 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Class</h2>
In class we went though a presentation onthe history of audio, from early recordings of conversation to the invention of the phonograph to Musique concrÃ¨te. Its great when each of you subjects intersect, it feels like learning these relly neich things are applicable, I was studying yasunao tone and John Cage in my cultures class and they intersect with the musique concrÃ¨te movment... sort of.

The second half of the class was on FX and plugins in Reaper and how someone could create their disiered effect. we looked mainly into Gates(my understanding is that they limit frequences under a sertain point, usful for dimming background sound), EQ(allows you do ajust certain frequences, usful for getting rid of highs or lows in a signal), and reverbe(reverbe is the sound made in large rooms, sort of like echo but not really. it allows you to change the room the audio was recorded in).

I had a play around and tried to get this recording of a pig to sound like a see saw or a rocking chair:

It was supporsingly hard, not ony to understand what the tools were doing by I realised how hard it is to put a thought words, then use the words to fix a problem. Learning terminology and knowing what I'm doing will be very helpful.

Still no progress on the assignment but I will get it done. I'm sure.

- Pre-reading
    - First I read "David Byrne - Technology Shapes Music [How Music Works]"
        - Really fascinating, the psoychlogy and philosophy of truth are always interesting ðŸ˜‹ also interesting to think about the way technologies have shaped the way we play music(and act). 
    - Then I read "The Man And The Woman And The Edison Phonograph - Bruce Watson AJE: Australasian Journal of Ecocriticism and Cultural Ecology, Vol. 1, 2011/2012"
        - Also interesting, I think Byrne said somthing in the previous text about the paths of history. with one small change we could be living in a completely differant world. Its great to see tht this mistake was corrected

- Think about Assignment 
Ok... for now lets go with the movie review
