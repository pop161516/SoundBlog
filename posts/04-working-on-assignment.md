<h2 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Class</h2>

**Super** short lecture.

Then I had some class time to work on my assignment.

<h2 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Assignment</h2>

This week I started writing my script. 

I had to keep reminding myself of the 1-3 minute time restriction, because I kept writing over.

I ended up writing about the MIFF(Melbourneebourn International Film Festival) becuase it had just started and I'd been keen to see some new movies for a while.

> *Intro sound*
Hey everyone thanks for tuning in, I'm Mataso and today we have a pretty special episode because we'll be discussing the MIFF, 
*sparkle* 
yes the Melbourne International Film Festival is back in full swing with its 72nd celebration of film, featuring tonnes of great new movies from local and abroad. In this series, I'll talk you through some of the films I've had the pleasure of catching so hopefully you can snag up one of the tickets for yourself 
*cash to till sound* 
or maybe catch it when it comes to theatres. 
So without further delay let's get into the films. 
*MIFF sound* 
So just last week, as of recording this, I ventured down to the Kino cinema at Colin's place to see a selection of animated shorts, WTF shorts and a feature film called "We Were Dangerous". I'll go through each of these in more depth next episode and on my blog but for now, we'll focus on the animated shorts. 
So, despite being 20 minutes early, the lines were massive
*background sound of talking* 
I suggest getting to smaller theatres like the Kino early since they don't often have reserved seats, luckily on my own, I managed to grab a good seat while the larger groups got a little split up. Anyway, this collection of shorts was really interesting, all of them looked spectacular and had a breath of emotional themes from Cynthia Calvi's film Gigi's, vibrant Celebration of Identity and Gender to Hossein Molayemi and Shirin Sohani's film In the Shadow of the Cypress, elegantly unpacking the effects posttraumatic stress disorder.
For me, a stand out was HurikÃ¡n a hilarious piece from director Jan Saska following a man/pig journey for a keg in a wild district in Prague. 
*Pig noise?*
A great example of minimal and tasteful 3D animation that pays beautiful homage to some of the techniques in traditional animation. humour and action caught me and the rest of the cinema's attention, as I found myself invested in such a simple story.
Every one of the animations was terrific although I will note aside from Alexey Evstigneev's film Father's Letters (the winner of the best animated short film), and HurikÃ¡n there wasn't much variation in types of animation the standard being the 2D drawing. 
*paper fold* 
Having said that it's remarkable the amount of variety of distinct styles throughout each of the films
In terms of collections of animations, I also had the opportunity to see the Melbourne International Animation Festival earlier this year, which was amazing. 
*star/holy sound plays* If you're into animation of any kind, or want a laugh or cry I would highly suggest their screenings. Particularly in terms of diversity in animation techniques.
Anyway, I hope you've enjoyed this episode and I'll to see you back here next week when I'll go through some of the other films and shorts I got to see while the MIFF's on. see you next time.

<h2 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Homework</h2>

- Pre-reading
    - First I read "David Byrne - Technology Shapes Music [How Music Works]"
        - Really fascinating, the psoychlogy and philosophy of truth are always interesting ðŸ˜‹ also interesting to think about the way technologies have shaped the way we play music(and act). 
    - Then I read "The Man And The Woman And The Edison Phonograph - Bruce Watson AJE: Australasian Journal of Ecocriticism and Cultural Ecology, Vol. 1, 2011/2012"
        - Also interesting, I think Byrne said somthing in the previous text about the paths of history. with one small change we could be living in a completely differant world. Its great to see tht this mistake was corrected

- Think about Assignment
