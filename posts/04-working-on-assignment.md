- Pre-reading
    - First I read "David Byrne - Technology Shapes Music [How Music Works]"
        - Really fascinating, the psoychlogy and philosophy of truth are always interesting ðŸ˜‹ also interesting to think about the way technologies have shaped the way we play music(and act). 
    - Then I read "The Man And The Woman And The Edison Phonograph - Bruce Watson AJE: Australasian Journal of Ecocriticism and Cultural Ecology, Vol. 1, 2011/2012"
        - Also interesting, I think Byrne said somthing in the previous text about the paths of history. with one small change we could be living in a completely differant world. Its great to see tht this mistake was corrected

- Think about Assignment 
???
