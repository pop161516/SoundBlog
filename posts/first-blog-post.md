## Class

Just getting familiar with the cource and had a look at the assignments. 
We finished early 😏


## Assignment

Rob told us about the assignment. Seems pretty broad which is good... and bad🤔
He mentioned something about being able to do an interview or a movie review... and I **LOVE** moives🤩
So thats the plan for now... not sure if it will be a real review(as in a new moive) or I'll write a review for a moive I really like... or one I really hate😈

## Homework

- Get the diary online ✅
    - I learnt a little bit of HTML and CSS in Digital Media Studio(DMS) last semster and thought it would be a cool way to blog... 
- Think about assignment 〰️
    - sort of... not much planning but I did have a look through it.
