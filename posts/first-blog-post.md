## Class

Just getting familiar with the course and had a look at the assignments. 
We finished early 😏


## Assignment

Rob told us about the assignment. Seems pretty broad which is good... and bad🤔
He mentioned something about being able to do an interview or a movie review... and I **LOVE** moives🤩
So that's the plan for now... not sure if it will be a real review(as in a new movie) or I'll write a review for a movie I really like... or one I really hate😈

## Homework

- Get the diary online ✅
    - I learnt a little bit of HTML and CSS in Digital Media Studio(DMS) last semester and thought it would be a cool way to blog... 
    - I was supporised to see how short these posts can be. I usualy write super long blog posts so I'll try to keep it short. 🙇‍♂️
- Think about assignment 〰️
    - sort of... not much planning but I did have a look through it.
- Buy headphones ✅
    - I bought a $20 pair from JB-HI-FI 🫡
    - Though I still don't really understand why Bluetooth would be so bad🤷‍♂️
