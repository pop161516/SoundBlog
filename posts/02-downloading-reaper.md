<h2 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Class</h2>

Today in class we *zoomed* through a bunch of slides. lots of stuff about the science of music, really interesting but really brief.
Then we downloaded Reaper and learned how to drop in tracks, how to use basic fades and transitions, and how to adjust the modified and master volume.

Then we had the oppotunity to play around with the 'ZOOM H4n'
We laernt what each button did then went outside to record some sounds...

<h2 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Assignment</h2>

Still thinking, haven't nailed down if I'll do a movie review yet...
if it were a review how would the sound be used?
- intro song
- outro song
- 'foley' sound effects
- background sound
- ???

What movie will I pick🤔
I need to remember it's only 1 minute...🙊

<h2 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Homework</h2>

- Pre-reading
    - I forgot whether I'm supposed to read the text before class so I can discuss or read it after to have a better understanding (because the texts seem to pretty much outline the class content🤷‍♂️)
    - Anyway I read "Michel Chion - Three Modes of Listening [Taken from 'The Audiovisual Contract']"
        - Really interesting, I've never really thought about the difference in hearing and listening and the ability of humans to create artificial sound for 'unnatural' or recreational purposes.
- Think about Assignment 
    - again... sort of... I have a bunch of other subject assignments this week so after I've finished with them I'll lock in for this assignment 🫡
