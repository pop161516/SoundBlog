<h2 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Class</h2>

The lecture was cool... we talked about music theory and how to use a MIDI(Musical Instrument Digital Interface) in Reaper.
I've plated a bit of piano and guitar so I could grasp the music theory concepts but I feel like the people who might not know na instrument may have struggled to keep up or remember some of the stuff we brushed over.ü´†

ü´£I also left early(as in when the lecture finished) this week... because I wanted to borrow a Zoom Mic and get straight to recording... üò°It's really annoying how you can't borrow equipment for more than a day... but I guess it forces me to be prodctiveü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Ok... we got it all doneüòÖ

First I used the Zoom mic I'd borrowed to record myself reading the script. Pretty easy.
Then I went down the list of the sound effects in my script and found things in my house to make the noise. 
- skipped intro and outro... for now
- skipped sparkle
- Background talking, I mentioned in an earlier blog post I had been recording background sounds of people talking at the cinema.
- Pig noise, I was originally going to use the snippet we were given in class but it's more fun to oink yourselfüêΩ
- Paper folds, I didn't like the sounds of my paper folds(they weren't as recognisable as I wanted) so I pivoted to pen scribble sounds, even though it dosen't quite fit what I was saying I think the message gets across.
- skipped holy sound.

Then I edited them all together, cutting out all the bad takes of my script read and leaving space for sound effects.

Next, I went back to the ones I'd skipped and looked on a sound library. <a href="https://freesound.org/ "> freesound.org </a> 

I found some amazing aura and sparkle sounds that I bookmarked for future projects...

I also added in a few extras sounds like...
- Coins being snatched, recorded by yours truly
- Waves in an ocean.

- Clapping sounds, recorded by me at the MIFF

Finally, I used the tutorials from class to construct an intro/outro tune. I started by playing the tune on a piano at home, then playing it into the MIDI.

Finding the right sound and messing with the attack, decay, sustain, volume and pitch was lots of fun and great to learn.

I found that I The MIDI didn't play two notes at once, just the higher one. So I ended up making a second track wth a base to accompany the melody. I used the same sound for the intro and outro.
